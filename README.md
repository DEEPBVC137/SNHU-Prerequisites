# SNHU-Prerequisites
CS300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the CS300 course, the main problem was to understand how different data structures work and how to use them effectively. We worked on linked lists, sorting vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees to learn how to store and manage data efficiently.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by breaking down each data structure into smaller parts. I practiced implementing them one by one, which helped me see how they organize and access data. Understanding data structures is crucial because they help make programs run faster and use memory better.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I faced challenges like bugs in my code and difficulties understanding some concepts. I solved these problems by researching online, reading documentation, and reviewing class materials. Taking breaks also helped me come back with a fresh perspective.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project taught me to think about the best data structures for different tasks. I now consider how data will be used before starting to code, which helps me design better programs.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I learned the importance of writing clean and organized code. I now use comments and clear variable names, which makes it easier for me and others to understand the code later. This will help my programs be more adaptable to changes.
